# ColdBox: Hero to Superhero

## Getting Started

This repo contains a sample application built to showcase the advanced features of ColdBox, especially for building a BDD API.

To get the most out of the workshop, it is expected that a person
following along with this workshop will build their own app from scratch,
using this repository only as a guide. The code for the finished sample
app is included here under the `hcms` folder.

Check out the [prerequisites guide](PREREQUISITES.md) to make sure your system is ready to go.
